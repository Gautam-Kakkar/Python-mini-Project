# Python-mini-Project  
## Sorting Visualizer  

A Python-based graphical tool to visualize sorting algorithms using **Tkinter**. This project allows users to observe the step-by-step execution of popular sorting algorithms in an interactive and educational way.

---

## Features  
- Visualize **Insertion Sort**, **Selection Sort**, and **Bubble Sort**.  
- Interactive UI to shuffle bars or reset the visualization.  
- Displays the **time complexity** for each algorithm.  
- A clean and minimalistic design for an enhanced user experience.  
- Fully customizable input for the number of bars to sort.

## How to Use  

1. **Start the Application**: Upon running the script, you'll see an input screen.  
2. **Enter Number of Bars**: Specify the number of bars you'd like to sort.  
3. **Choose Sorting Algorithm**:  
   - **Insertion Sort**  
   - **Selection Sort**  
   - **Bubble Sort**  
4. **Observe**: Watch the sorting algorithm in action.  
5. **Shuffle or Reset**:  
   - Use the **Shuffle** button to randomize the bars again.  
   - Use the **Reset** button to restart the visualization.

## Future Enhancements  

- Add more sorting algorithms such as **Quick Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Heap Sort**.  
- Display the number of swaps and comparisons performed during sorting.  
- Include a progress tracker or percentage completion indicator.  
- Improve UI/UX with better visual elements and animations.  
- Add functionality to save sorting steps as a video or GIF.  
- Provide a side-by-side comparison of different sorting algorithms.
